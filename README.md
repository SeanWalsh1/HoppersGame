USER INSTRUCTIONS: After you have started the project and clicked "OK"
in the BlueJ applet window, a JOptionPane will prompt the user for every
frog location on the board. The user will select every lily pad location 
that will have a frog on it including the red frog. After you have selected
all lily pad locations with frogs on them, select "OK" at the bottom of the
JOptionPane window. Next, another JOptionPane window will appear. It will have
every lily pad location that you selected in the previous window. Select which
of the lily pad locations you would like to be the red frog. Once you have 
selected the red frog location, click the "OK" button at the bottom of the 
JOptionPane window. You now have a starting board state of frogs and can play
Hoppers. The rules of the game are as follows. A green frog may jump over another
green frog which will remove the frog which was jumped. A green frog can not jump
a red frog but a red frog can jump a green frog. Jumps can only be made between 
three lily pads. For example if you have a green frogs on pad1 and pad4 the frog on
pad1 may only jump to pad7 but it can not jump to pad10. The objective of the game
is to jump all the frogs so that the only frog left on the board at the end of the
game is the red frog.
